# Interactive-Infographics
 **Topic:** Space Exploration timeline
 
#**Cool stuffs in the webpage:**
• Responsive design: I made the webpage to be good in responsiveness like scrolling,
using buttons also the screen sizes according to the device size.
• Events: The webpage reads the events from script.js and then creates the event cards
which makes it easy to add or change data accordingly.
• Search and filter buttons: These use JavaScript to instantly update the timeline.
When we type in search bar or filter according to the category the code goes through
all available events and only shows the matching one.
• Smooth Scrolling: I added a scroll down functionality which makes the webpage
more interactive and helps to view the timeline smoothly. I did this using
‘IntersectionObserver’ in JavaScript.
• Popup: When you click on an event JavaScript takes the information of the specific
event and give the popup window with more detailed information of the events.
• Animated Backgrounds: I made a twinkling circles to look like stars and emojis in a
floating manner using CSS and JavaScript to imitate the space and make the webpage
more visually attractive.
Scrollbar: I styled the scrollbar to match the overall space theme with a gradient

#**Running the webpage:**
• Download and unzip the folder, the folder contains the index.html, style.css,
script.js code files and also the image folder with images.
• Now open the index.html file in a browser to view the webpage.

#**User Guide:**

• Explore by Scrolling: Scroll down the page to see the events in order. They will
appear as you scroll.
• Search for Events: At the top of the timeline, you will see a search box labeled
"Search space events". Type keywords into this box, like Apollo or Mars to quickly
find related events. The timeline will update as you type.
• Filter Events by Category: Below the search box I created some five filter buttons
"All Events", "Satellites", "Human Flight", "Planetary", and "Technology". Click on
any of these buttons to show only the events belonging to that specific category. The
"All Events" button will show everything again.
• View Event Details: Click on any of the event cards in the timeline. A popup window
will appear with more detailed information about that event including its mission
details, key achievements, and fun facts. Even the popup has a good layout design
style with scrolling down function.
